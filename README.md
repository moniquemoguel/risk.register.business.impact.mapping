#  Risk Register with Business Impact Mapping

## Overview
This repository demonstrates my professional approach to creating and maintaining a **Risk Register** with **Business Impact Mapping**. A critical tool in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) work.

A well-designed risk register doesn’t just list threats; it connects them to the **business outcomes they can disrupt**, helping decision-makers prioritize investments and actions.

---

## Why This Matters
Many organizations maintain risk logs without truly understanding:
- Which risks have the greatest potential business disruption
- How to quantify the cost of downtime, data loss, or reputation damage
- How to align mitigation priorities with business objectives

This project outlines a **framework** I use in professional engagements to structure risk data and map it to measurable business impact.
